# JobBoard-DevOps-Project
A scalable job board web application for minimum-wage earners, demonstrating Cloud and DevOps practices with AWS, Docker, Terraform, and GitHub Actions.

## Acknowledgments
The idea for this job board web application was inspired by my friends [Angel Osana](https://github.com/AngelOsana), [Raiza Palles](https://github.com/raizapalles), and [Alexsandra Duhac](https://github.com/alexsandraduhac2002-lab). Their insights into creating a platform for minimum-wage job seekers helped shape the vision for this project.
